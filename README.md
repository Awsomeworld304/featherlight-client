# WARNING
Please ignore my crackhead energy code. This is my first time dealing with networking in code.

# Featherlight Client
A command-line messaging client that supports all platforms!
My goal with this app is to connect people together without internet/WiFi.
It supports a wide varitey of messaging connections.
One big method is Bluetooth.

# The Server
There will be a server app made too. With the server you can connect to it and it will host more then one person like a group chat.
I don't know when I will start working on that so for now it's just an idea for later.

# Building Instructions
This part is easy. 
First download Visual Studio 2022.
Second, select the C# workload and install. 
Finally, when you load into the project, just build it as release.
Make sure to use Net6.0 though.
